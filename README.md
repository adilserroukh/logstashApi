# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

This code allows configure [logstash](https://www.elastic.co/es/products/logstash) via RESTful API.This is useful in cloud environments as k8s where is difficult send configuration files. Use [Swagger UI](http://localhost:8080/docs) to retreive all endpoints. Currently this api supports multiple-pipelines and patterns configuration.


### Running the server
To run the server, run:

```
npm start
```

To view the Swagger UI interface:

```
open http://localhost:8080/docs
```

This project leverages the mega-awesome [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) middleware which does most all the work.


### Testing api with standalone Logstash installation

* Download logstash from [elastic website](https://www.elastic.co/es/downloads/logstash)
* Set `LOGSTASH_CONFIG_PATH` ENV variable  visible to logstash process  & pointing to logstash main config dir (default `/usr/share/logstash/config`)
* Optional: change default credentials (elastic/changeme) setting following ENV variables:
  * `ELASTIC_USERNAME`
  * `ELASTIC_PASSWD`  
* API process needs this folders inside logstash config dir to run properly:
  * `patterns` : for patterns files
  * `pipeline` : for pipelines conf.
* Start logstash process with auto reloading config feature (`--config.reload.automatic`)
* Start api process `npm start`  from main folder of this project.
* Test api via [Swagger UI](http://localhost:8080/docs). Remember set credentials in Swagger UI, otherwise api returns `400` code.

### Testing logstash api with docker

* run command `docker build --tag api-logstash .` from root folder of this project
* run `docker-compose up` command from `docker` folder.
* Test api via [Swagger UI](http://localhost:8080/docs). Remember set credentials in Swagger UI, otherwise api returns `400` code.
